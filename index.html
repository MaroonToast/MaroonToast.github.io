				<p>Hey, I'm Maroon! An 18 year old software hobbyist, who kinda sucks at what they do. The language I use is lua, which is both applicable everywhere and completely useless. When I'm not working on one project that will inevitably be abandoned within a week, I'm usually playing games and having fun with my friends.</p>
				<p>I'm always open to new people, so if you'd like to stop by and say hi, feel free to do so! It's always a pleasure to meet new people.. unless it's not, but chances are you're not one of those people, eh?</p>
				<p>As for my projects, I usually make small, self contained tech demos testing out various programming tricks, which sometimes assemble into bigger projects... it's all coming together one day, you know it! As for long term project plans, I plan to make a turn based RPG style game, since that's one of my favorite genres!</p>
